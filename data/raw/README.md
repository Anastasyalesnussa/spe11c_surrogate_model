## Data Access & Download Instructions

This repository **does not include raw CO₂ storage datasets** because the SPE11C files exceed GitHub’s upload limits (25–1000 MB) and cannot be redistributed due to licensing.  
To reproduce all results, download the datasets from the official sources Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). [SPE Comparative Solution Project — Model 11C (3D CO₂ Injection)](https://spe.org/en/csp/spe11/ )
Or it can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e-rzJmojzgfIY0W_BE3d4paOzMvJCKL1?usp=sharing

- 3D spatial reservoir maps  
- Pressure and saturation fields  
- CO₂/H₂O mass components  
- Gas/liquid densities  
- Temperature  
- Time-series injection and plume evolution
